        <div class="flex-container">
            <div>I helped solve business problems and improve operational efficiency through several enterprise tools and initiatives, including:
                <br>• Web design system for commerces products based on angular material 2
                <br>• Loader App to facilitate ground ops to load packages to drones
                <br>• Drone Network Interface to enable internal users visualize the drone network
                <br>• Partner portal to enable partners to monitor and troubleshoot orders
                <br>• Web UI Kit to allow partners to integrate drone delivery to their services
            </div>
            <div>As a lead product designer, I created the first web commerce design system based on angular material 2, establishing consistency across commerce products with minimal dev time. I worked with 4 front end ENG on color, type, input, navigation, table, and many other design components, reducing the number of pair programming sessions for VQA.</div>
